OC: Asif Afridi

Subject: All Server Hanged/Malfunction

Dear Zubair,

I am writing to bring to your immediate attention that we are facing a critical issue with our system, where all our POS terminals are offline and hanged. This malfunction is affecting multiple areas:

1. Orders are not landing in the kitchen.
2. Old OQM orders are not showing up in POS, even when we try to punch them manually.
3. Foodpanda orders' auto-release feature is not working, although the orders are visible in OQM-C  "Get Order" section.

We have contacted Zubair IT and Salman NextGen, and they have informed us that it's a server issue on their end, which will take some time to resolve. They are working on it.

We’re doing orders manually until issue resolved.

Please find the attached pictures for your reference.

Thank you.

Regards,
*Hamza Nasir*
